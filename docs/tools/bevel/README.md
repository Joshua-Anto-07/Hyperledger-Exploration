## Introduction
### What is Hyperledger Bevel?
Bevel is a Blockchain Automation Framework designed for effortlessly deploying production-ready solutions with minimal effort.

The framework leverages Ansible, Helm, and Kubernetes to orchestrate the deployment of production DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) networks. DevOps Engineers utilize Ansible for network configuration, while Helm charts serve as instructions for deploying essential components within Kubernetes. Kubernetes is chosen for its flexibility, enabling the Blockchain Automation Framework to deploy DLT networks across any Kubernetes- supported cloud environment.

Hyperledger BEVEL specializes in deploying Hyperledger Fabric networks, employing YAML files for network configuration. When Ansible executes its playbook, which handles tasks such as setting up channels or adding a peer, it takes a network YAML file as input to ensure proper configuration and deployment.
